# BLDC-motor-drive-Sim

In this repository some Matlab Simulations of BLDC motor drive were shared.

Download the ".mdl" file and open with Matlab with versions from 2018a


  1. The file "Two_phase_mode_inverter.mdl", is to configure the switches for driving the BLDC motor.
  2. The file "batter_fed_BLDC.mdl", is to operate the Simulink model of BLDC motor in Open Loop mode of operation.
  3. The file "Discrete_speed_control.mdl", is to control the BLDC motor model in closed loop mode for a given speed command.  


These files could be the starting point for designing the custom BLDC motor drive projects.
